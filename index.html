<h1>What it is</h1>
<p>htmltomarkdown is script written to convert html pages to markdown in purpose of creating readmes and other<br>
things that need to be written in markdown. It's useful for people that knows html language and don't want to loose time for learning markdown (at least I didn't, that's why it's here)</p>
<hr>
<h1>What it use</h1>
<p>From external libraries it's using only BeautifulSoup4</p>
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">BeautifulSoup4 on pypi</a>
<hr>
<h1>What it can</h1>
<p>For now it can convert emphasis, headers, links, images and will be more (according to markdown cheatsheet here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)<br>
Lists will be soon (still refactoring)</p>
